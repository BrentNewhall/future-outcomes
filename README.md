# Future Outcomes

This web app provides a web interface for a tabletop RPG called _Future
Outcomes_. With this web app, you can create and run characters using the
_Future Outcomes_ system.

Each character is made up of a set of Moves. Your GM will tell you how many
Moves you can add to your character beyond the default at character creation.
Typically, you can add 2 Moves beyond the defaults.

In play, tap on a Move's name and two different outcomes will be highlighted.
You may choose which Move actually occurs; just tap on it. If you choose a
negative Move (it will be slightly grayed out), you will get a point of Luck.

If you have Luck points, then after you have generates two Outcomes you can
tap the _Redeem_ button to spend one Luck and improve each Outcome by one.
